# Generic Benign IDS Model using Clustering

To understand the behavior of benign (normal traffic) data and classify them into different clusters based on their common properties. Also, to analyze and compare how the benign traffic is different across datasets. Finally, use this information to build a generic benign classifier using a distance threshold.
